== JBake artifact available on Maven Central

I'm pleased to announce that JBake v2.1 is now available on http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.jbake%7Cjbake-core%7C2.1.1%7Cjar[Maven Central]. 
Thanks go to https://twitter.com/aldrinleal[Aldrin Leal] for helping guide me through the release process.

If you'd like to use JBake in your project then here's the dependency information you'll need:

----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jbake</groupId>
	<artifactId>jbake-core</artifactId>
	<version>2.1.1</version>
</dependency>

More news soon about the upcoming v2.2 release and maybe a little more on Maven.
