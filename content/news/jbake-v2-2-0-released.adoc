== JBake v2.2.0 released

I'm pleased to announce that JBake v2.2.0 is now available for download! The big addition in this release 
is support for http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] formatted content, thanks to the http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor project].

Here's the full release notes for this version...

*Enhancements:*

* Add support for AsciiDoc format
* Add support for serving up baked site locally
* Add automatic publishing based on date
* Look for jbake.properties as well
* Add command line option to create required structure
* Add version ouput when JBake is ran
* Speed up AsciiDoc rendering be reusing Asciidoctor object
* Add support for .adoc extension

*Bugs:*

* Content header is being picked up from middle of content file but it shouldn't be
* Date for AsciiDoc formatted files is last modified date instead of revision date
* Baking is considerably slow on large site (~250 pages across many sub-folders)

Updated link:/docs/[documentation] has also been released for this release along with a refresh of 
this site. From this release onwards the project will be adopting the http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] 
system.

This new release should also be available via Maven Central in the next few days.

Download *link:/download.html[JBake v2.2.0]* now and get baking!
