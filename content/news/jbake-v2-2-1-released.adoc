I'm pleased to announce that JBake v2.2.1 is now available for download! This is mainly a maintenance release that addresses a couple 
of issues, specifically with AsciiDoc support and character encoding.

Here's the full release notes for this version...

* Allow date format used to be customised via configuration
* Switched to Pegdown Markdown processor
* Added support for rendering sitemap.xml
* Added character encoding to configuration which is used for rendering 
* AsciiDoc related improvements
* Addressed multiple issues in default templates
* Cleaned up imports and unused variables
