== Interview on Cynical Developer podcast

I got the opportunity recently to be interviewed on the http://cynicaldeveloper.com/[Cynical Developer] http://cynicaldeveloper.com/feed/podcast[podcast] by 
James Studdart who I discovered through the local https://www.meetup.com/Chester-Devs/[Chester Devs] group.

The interview covered what static site generation is, where it came from, why it's called baking, what the benefits are of static sites and how JBake fits into it all.

You can listen to the interview http://cynicaldeveloper.com/podcast/4/[here] and make sure you subscribe to the http://cynicaldeveloper.com/feed/podcast[podcast] as well 
to find out more about a range of development technologies.
