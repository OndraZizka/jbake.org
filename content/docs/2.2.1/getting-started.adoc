. link:/download.html[Download] and unzip JBake into a folder on your hard disk

JBake v2.2.0-SNAPSHOT (2013-10-12 22:43) [http://jbake.org]

Usage: jbake ...
----

=== Usage

* Run `jbake` to do some baking, this will use the current folder as the source and place any baked output into an `output` folder in the current folder
* Or you can run `jbake <source_folder> <destination_folder>` if you want full control over the source & destination folders

=== Quick Start

To get up and running quickly with JBake you can use its base project structure as a starting point for your site.

----
$ mkdir project
$ cd project
$ jbake -i
----

The `-i` option initialises the current folder with the necessary folder structure along with a default set of templates 
to get you started.

Once you have added some real content to your site and customised the templates you can bake your site by running the following commands:

----
$ cd project
$ jbake
----

This will place your baked site in the `output` folder by default. You can then see what it looks like 
immediately by running JBake in server mode:

----
$ cd project
$ jbake -s
JBake v2.2.0-SNAPSHOT (2013-10-12 22:43) [http://jbake.org]

Serving out contents of: [output] on http://localhost:8820/
(To stop server hit CTRL-C)
----

You can then preview your site in your browser at http://localhost:8820. You can configure what port the server 
runs via your link:#configuration[configuration file].

You can also specify the folder to serve out along with the `-s` option like so:

----
$ jbake -s /home/user/site/output/
JBake v2.2.0-SNAPSHOT (2013-10-12 22:43) [http://jbake.org]

Serving out contents of: [/home/user/site/output/] on http://localhost:8820/
(To stop server hit CTRL-C)
----

That's all there is to it, to getting your own baked site! 

=== Base Project Structure

The base project structure and sample templates are contained in `base.zip` in your JBake installation folder. If you'd like to 
change the structure or sample templates in some way then extract the contents of this file, update as required, then ZIP them back 
up and replace the `base.zip` file with your updated file. Then JBake will use your updated file when ever it initialises a new folder.
