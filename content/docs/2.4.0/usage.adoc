== Usage

=== Bake command

The bake command mixes your source content with your templates and cooks it all into a fully baked web site. You have a number of different ways to execute the bake 
command to suite your requirements.

The `-b` option without any parameters will assume your source content is in the current working directory and will place the baked output into a directory named `output` 
in the current directory:

----
$ jbake -b
----

NOTE: JBake will create this `output` directory if it does not already exist.

If you specify only the source directory as a parameter then the output directory will automatically be generated inside the source directory:

----
$ jbake -b <source>
----

You can also specify your source directory and output directory to enable you to have full control over the baking process:

----
$ jbake -b <source> <output>
----

You can even omit the `-b` option as bake is the default command for the command line interface of JBake:

----
$ jbake <source> <output>
----

You can even go as far to omit all options and parameters to execute the bake command:

----
$ jbake
----

NOTE: Again JBake will assume your source content is in the current working directory will place the baked output into `output`.

=== Initialisation command

The initialisation command will seed your project directory with the required project structure along with a number of sample content files and templates. You do have the 
option to choose what template engine is used though.

The `-i` option will seed the current working directory and use the http://freemarker.org[Freemarker] template engine by default:

----
$ jbake -i
----

You can also specify the directory to initialise by supplying an additional parameter:

----
$ jbake -i <directory>
----

To specify the template engine you can use the `-t` option along with another parameter:

----
$ jbake -i -t <freemarker|groovy|thymeleaf>
----

NOTE: The template engines available are http://freemarker.org[Freemarker], http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] and http://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf].

=== Server command

The server command will allow you to see what your baked site looks like when served out by a HTTP web server, great for when you want to preview your site using 
your local web browser.

The `-s` option will start JBake in server mode allowing you to preview your baked site at http://localhost:8820/ by default it will serve out the contents of the 
`output` directory in the current working directory:

----
$ jbake -s
----

NOTE: The local port used can be changed via the configuration file.

You can specify the directory to serve out by supplying an additional parameter:

----
$ jbake -s <directory>
----

=== Combining commands

It is possible to combine certain JBake commands together like so:

----
$ jbake -b -s
----

This will bake your site first and then serve the output out using the built in server, using the defaults mentioned above.
